## Session 2026-06-30 — bundle heap-use-after-free (test_issues_jit crash)

CI failure: test_issues_jit bundle SIGABRT during test_issue_297
with "corrupted size vs. prev_size while consolidating". 6 tests
in the bundle failed; bundle exited with rc=-6.

Root cause was TWO coupled bugs, both needed:

**Bug 1 (src/core/ast.ixx)**: commit e5f559bf ("fix warning")
removed `node_first_mutation_` from the move-ctor and explicit
ctor init lists to silence a -Wreorder warning. Default member
init used `new_delete_resource` while sibling columns used the
arena's monotonic_buffer_resource — mixed allocators during
~FlatAST(). Restored `node_first_mutation_(std::move(...))` and
`node_first_mutation_(alloc)` to the two init lists. Copy ctor
/ copy assign already had it.

**Bug 2 (src/core/arena.ixx) — the REAL one**: compact()/defrag()
called `resource_.release()` in rebuild_resource_() which reset
the bump pointer to `buffer_.data()`. Next arena_.create<FlatAST>
allocated at the buffer start, OVERWRITING earlier live FlatASTs
that dtors_ still held pointers to. When ~CompilerService() ran
~arena_() → run_destructors(), ~FlatAST() was called twice on
the same arena address. The first call decremented binding_gens_
use_count 1→0 and freed the control block; the second call
read use_count of the freed block — heap-use-after-free.

Diag confirmed: 5 ctors + 4 dtors before ASan abort, with ctor
#5 at the same arena address as ctor #1 (arena memory reuse).

Fix: rebuild_resource_() now a no-op. Bump pointer stays at
start + stats_.used (just past live data). std::vector::resize
shrink preserves capacity, so the bump pointer remains valid.

Commit 02dd097e pushed to origin/main. Verified:
  test_issue_300 standalone: 10/10 PASS
  test_issues_jit bundle: 57/57 PASS (was the failing bundle)
  All 4 JIT bundles ASan-clean.
  
test_issue_226 test_doomsday_stress has a SEPARATE pre-existing
UAF (verified via git stash before fix) — concurrent fiber
stress, unrelated to this fix. Track as separate issue.

**Pattern**: when an ASan-detected UAF appears on a member that
"shouldn't" be shared (shared_ptr with use_count=1 in every
~dtor), check if the destructor is being invoked twice on the
same memory because of arena address reuse after a reset/rebuild.
